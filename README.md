# Python-Challenge

PyBank Instructions
In this assignment, I'll be using the concepts I've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where my newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

PyBank Instructions
In this PyBank Challenge, my tasked is creating a Python script to analyze the financial records. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv, composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
  1.) The total number of months included in the dataset.
  2.) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
  3.) The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
  4.) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
  5.) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

My result should reflect the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, my tasked are helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
  1.) The total number of votes cast.
  2.) A complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3.) The percentage of votes each candidate won.
  4.) The total number of votes each candidate won.
  5.) The winner of the election based on popular vote.

My result should reflect the following:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
